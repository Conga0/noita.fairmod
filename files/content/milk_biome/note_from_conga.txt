--stylua: ignore start
Hi!
Originally I meant to make a milk biome but I couldn't really figure out where to put it, let alone how it would function mechanically.

I did make an enemy called the milk man which throws milk potions and has a 20% chance to drop a bottomless milk potion on death,
I think he's interesting enough to put in the game somewhere so he spawns randomly throughout the map currently.

If you want to do anything with this or shoot ideas then go ahead
I disabled the code which injects the biome into the biome map but I'm sure you know how to uncomment if you're working on this mod.
If you don't, bless your innocent soul.
